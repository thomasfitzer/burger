# Burger App
The point of this full stack app was to create a site where you could enter in a burger
you wanted to eat, it would list it, then you could click on a button to send it to a 
"eaten" section of the page.

## Different Codes Used
The various methods used to create this app included: node, mysql, express, and handlebars.

### Node
Node was used in this app to install all of the necessary modules required for the app,
along with starting up the server to connect everything.

### MySQL
MySQL was used to create the database for all of the burgers, a place where the infor could 
be pulled from and stored to.

### Express
Is basically used to help pull data from a server and put it on there. (I'll be honest, I know
this either isn't the whole definition or not what it is, but I left it until the last minute,
and my brain is completely fried.)

### Handlebars
This mustache inspried tool streamlines the code that is needed to produce an html page, and makes it
far easier to connect to a server or javascript file.

## Process
My process for making this app was a bit flawed, as I left things until the last minute, and didn't check
stuff as I went along, so I threw a bunch of code up there, and when I couldn't get the app to display on
the web server, I ran out of time to figure out exactly where I went wrong. I'll be asking for help in the
in the near future to try and get this right and resubmit it.
